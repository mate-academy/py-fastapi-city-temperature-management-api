### Setting Up and Running the FastAPI City Temperature Management API Project 🚀

Welcome to the FastAPI City Temperature Management API project! Follow these comprehensive steps to get the project up and running smoothly on your local machine.

### Step 1: Acquire Your Weather API Key 🌦️

1. Register or log in to your account on [Weather API](https://www.weatherapi.com/).
2. Create a new project to obtain your unique API key.

### Step 2: Download the Project and Navigate to the Directory 📂

1. Clone the project repository:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/kostomeister/py-fastapi-city-temperature-management-api
    ```

2. Change into the project directory:

    ```bash
    cd py-fastapi-city-temperature-management-api
    ```

### Step 3: Set Up a Virtual Environment (Optional but Recommended) ⚙️

Create a virtual environment to isolate project dependencies. This step is optional but highly recommended for managing dependencies:

```bash
python -m venv venv
```

Activate the virtual environment:

- **On Windows:**
  ```bash
  .\venv\Scripts\activate
  ```

- **On macOS and Linux:**
  ```bash
  source venv/bin/activate
  ```

### Step 4: Install Dependencies 📦

Install the required dependencies from the `requirements.txt` file:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Step 5: Configure Your API Key and Database Connection 🗝️

1. In the root directory of your project, create a `.env` file.
2. Insert your API key into the `.env` file using the following format:

    ```plaintext
    API_KEY=your_api_key
    ```

### Step 6: Run Database Migrations 🛠️

Execute the Alembic commands to create the database and tables:

```bash
alembic upgrade head
```

### Step 7: Launch FastAPI with Uvicorn 🚂

Start FastAPI using Uvicorn:

```bash
uvicorn main:app --reload
```

### Step 8: Explore Documentation and Test the API 📚

Visit [http://127.0.0.1:8000/docs](http://127.0.0.1:8000/docs) in your web browser to access the automatic API documentation generated by FastAPI. Test each endpoint and explore the functionalities.


### Additional Notes ℹ️

- Replace `"your_api_key"` with your actual API key.
- Ensure your virtual environment is activated when running commands.
- Refer to the project's documentation for troubleshooting or community support.

Congratulations! Your FastAPI City Temperature Management API is now up and running. Explore and enjoy building on top of this robust foundation for your project. 🌟
