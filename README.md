## Task Description


You are required to create a FastAPI application that manages city data and their corresponding temperature data. The application will have two main components (apps):

1. A CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) API for managing city data.
2. An API that fetches current temperature data for all cities in the database and stores this data in the database. This API should also provide a list endpoint to retrieve the history of all temperature data.

### Part 1: City CRUD API

1. Create a new FastAPI application.
2. Define a Pydantic model `City` with the following fields:
    - `id`: a unique identifier for the city.
    - `name`: the name of the city.
    - `additional_info`: any additional information about the city.
3. Implement a SQLite database using SQLAlchemy and create a corresponding `City` table.
4. Implement the following endpoints:
    - `POST /cities`: Create a new city.
    - `GET /cities`: Get a list of all cities.
    - `GET /cities/{city_id}`: Get the details of a specific city.
    - `PUT /cities/{city_id}`: Update the details of a specific city.
    - `DELETE /cities/{city_id}`: Delete a specific city.

### Part 2: Temperature API

1. Define a Pydantic model `Temperature` with the following fields:
    - `id`: a unique identifier for the temperature record.
    - `city_id`: a reference to the city.
    - `date_time`: the date and time when the temperature was recorded.
    - `temperature`: the recorded temperature.
2. Create a corresponding `Temperature` table in the database.
3. Implement an endpoint `POST /temperatures/update` that fetches the current temperature for all cities in the database from an online resource of your choice. Store this data in the `Temperature` table. You should use an async function to fetch the temperature data.
4. Implement the following endpoints:
    - `GET /temperatures`: Get a list of all temperature records.
    - `GET /temperatures/?city_id={city_id}`: Get the temperature records for a specific city.
