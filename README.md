# City Temperature Management API ☁️

This FastAPI application manages city data and their corresponding temperature data. It consists of two main components:

1. **City CRUD API**: Manages city data including creating, reading, updating, and deleting cities.
2. **Temperature API**: Fetches current temperature data for all cities and provides endpoints to retrieve temperature history.

## Design Choices 💻

- **SQLite Database**: SQLite is used as the database engine for simplicity and ease of setup. However, the application can be easily adapted to use other databases supported by SQLAlchemy.

- **OpenWeatherMap API**: The OpenWeatherMap API is used to fetch current temperature data for cities. It provides a simple and free-to-use API for weather data.
