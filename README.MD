# City temperature API
Simple FastAPI application for managing cities data and corresponding temperatures records using outer weather API.
___

## ðŸ”§ Technologies used and design choices:
* [X] FastAPI: quick and reliable Python framework with support of asynchronous operations.
* [X] SQAlchemy: great tool for managing ORM with asyncio support.
* [X] SQLite: widely chosen and clear in usage database. Also is possible to use PostgreSQL or other preferable relational databases. 
* [X] Pydantic: powerful instrument for handling serializing, deserializing and validation of data. 
* [X] Alembic: great and suitable tool for database migration managing.  
* [X] WeatherAPI: outer API chosen for fetching actual temperature records in real time.

## ðŸ§¾ Project structure and endpoint details

---
### City app (folder "city")
Part of the application responsible for CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) API operations for managing city data.
### Temperature app (folder "temperature")
An API that fetches current temperature data from WeatherAPI for all cities in the database and stores this data, also responds for retrieving the history of all temperature data.
### Endpoints
All project endpoints are available in clear documentation. Use "http://127.0.0.1:8000/docs".
